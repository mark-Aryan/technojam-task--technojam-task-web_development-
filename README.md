I have created a website " codeExploit " by Django Framework, this Website is for Developers.
Here anyone can upload there work, by Domain.
Not only Upload but also view or delete projects.

# Challenges
So According to the time period 4-DAYS, its very hard to think and create a static project.
I received this message on 23-11-2021-6:26, and next 3-Days contain my CAT-I ( 2 Exam a Day ). 
So, Its hard to create project as well ass study for my CAT-I, it takes 1hr to decide a Project For Developers.
